# The smoke-tests role contains the following jobs:
#
# - global-properties: Dummy BOSH job used to host global parameters that are
#   required to configure SCF
#
# - authorize-internal-ca: Install both internal and UAA CA certificates
#
# - smoke_tests: The smoke tests errand can be configured to run quick set of
#   tests against a specific Cloud Foundry API endpoint to determine is basic
#   push-application functionality works. Consider running the acceptance tests
#   errand for a more extensive set of tests.
